# MyTodolist

This is a simple Todo-list application that I created as a fun project to learn Android and develop an app that I find useful. I hope that you find it useful too ;-).

## Features
- A todo item will have description, body and comments, possibly also deadline.
- There may be alarms to set for items.
- Possible integration with Google Calendar...?
- Feel free to suggest features ;-).
